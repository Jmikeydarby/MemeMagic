## Meme Magic

It's a terrible name, I know. Doesn't summarize this app at all. Here it is:
Meme Magic is a heavy handed backend boiler plate with some very light front end stuff set up. What little is set up on the front end is beautiful (PropTypes, Immutable.js for Redux Store, ES6), and the backend has IP tracing to relocate sessions to users.

## Motivation

I built this to be a performant, easy to deploy, ES6 God, and most importantly - sketchy boiler plate for my students at Fullstack Academy to get a good glimpse of boiler plate work and the foundation for a good app.

## Installation

This codebase has two criteria:

A:

  I am sadly a WSL user (Yes, Windows, Subsystem, (for) Linux), so I can't run post-install pg-init scripts. So step 1 is make a new psql database named `meme-magic`. Thats it.

B:

  Make a `secrets.js` file in the root directory. It should contain:

  `export default {
    SessionKey: 'WhateverYouWant'
  };`

That's it. Enjoy.

## Tests

Tests are my current step in this project - 12/14/16
